### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Martina, I live in London, I am a former nurse and psychotherapist who discovered a passion for coding and decided to translate her problem-solving skills into tech as a developer. 
This page is for me to display some of the projects I have worked on and that I am proud of.
